Final test set results (without log):
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 122,884.60
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 188,582.69
R-squared: 0.61

Final test set results (with log(1+price)):
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 120,297.07
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 190,551.24
R-squared: 0.60

MAE better than without log but RMSE and R-squared slightly worse

Ridge regression instead of LR doesn't show any improvement

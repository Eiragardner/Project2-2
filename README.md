# Project2-2
Project Overview

The Dutch housing market suffers from issues like overvaluation and inconsistent appraisals. Our goal is to build a reliable and explainable machine learning model that can predict property prices using features like living space, location, year built, and more.

We compare three ML models:

Linear Regression (baseline)

Random Forest

XGBoost

We also apply SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret feature importance.
